    "The RF coils are typically separated in transmit and receive coils because of different requirements: the transmit coils for excitation are designed to be homogeneous in depositing energy across the field-of-view (FOV), while receive coils are designed for maximum maximum sensitivity to the relatively small signals detectable from the spins.

These are designed to add and subtract from the main magnetic field.  Since the magnetic field determines the resonance frequency ($f = \\bar{\\gamma} \\|\\vec{B}\\|$), this will create a spatial variations in the magnetic field that can be used to separate signals from different locations and ultimately create images.
