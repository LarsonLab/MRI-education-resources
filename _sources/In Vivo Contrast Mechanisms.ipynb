    "# In Vivo Contrast Mechanisms\n",

    "In addition to the basic contrast mechanisms based on T1, T2 and proton density, in vivo tissues and interactions create additional sources of contrast.  These include T2*, susceptibility, fat versus water, and admisistration of contrast agents.  Additional important sources of contrast in vivo include flow and magnetization transfer, but these are not covered here.\n"

    "Differences in magnetic susceptibility between materials and tissues create differences in the local magnetic field.  This leads to differences in the resonance frequency of the spins, which can be used to create contrast in MRI images.  Local changes in resonance frequency can also lead to changes in measured transverse relaxation time, and this phenomenon is referred to as $T_2^*$ relaxation. \n",

    "\n",
    "The off-resonance causes the transverse magnetization to precess at a different rate.  When imaging is performed, the transverse magnetization will have a different phase depending on this off-resonance.  This difference in phase can be detected, and leads to phase differences in the resulting images.  When trying to create susceptibility contrast, other sources of phase differences must be removed.  These other sources of phase differences include imperfections in the main magnetic field, chemical shift effects, and RF coil induced phase.\n",

    "Ideally, the MRI signal decays with a time constant of $T_2$, the transverse decay rate.  However, in practice every imaging voxel contains off-resonance that leads to changes in the signal decay.  We characterize this change in signal decay with $T_2^*$.  \n",

This is called \"de-phasing\", and means that when the transverse magnetization is averaged across the voxel it's overall magnitude is reduced.  This is illustrated in the examples below (generated by ``t2star_spinecho_illustration.m``)\n",

The macroscopic dephasing is caused by differences in magnetic susceptibility between materials and tissues.\n",
