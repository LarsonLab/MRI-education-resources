    "where $y$ is the acquired data, $\\mathbf{E}$ is the encoding matrix, $x$ is the spatial distribution of the transverse magnetization (e.g. image), and $n$ is noise.  In this formulation, the image is vectorized.  For example, 2D FT sampled data and the corresponding 2D image would be converted to:\n",

    "Linear predictability parallel imaging methods assume that each k-space sample is a linear combination of other k-space samples and inlcude the methods of AUTO-SMASH, GRAPPA, and SPIRiT.  These utilize a calibration kernel, computed from the data itself and captured in the matrix $\\mathbf{G}$, and can be generally formulated as the following optimization problem\n",

    "### SNR in Parallel Imaging\n",
    "\n",
    "There is an SNR penalty when using these methods that varies in severity depending on the conditioning of the undersampled reconstruction matrix.  Variation in RF coil element sensitivity profiles in the direction of the undersampling leads to a more well-conditioned reconstruction and lower SNR penalty.  Conversely, less RF coil element sensitivity profile variation in the direction of the undersampling leads to a more ill-conditioned reconstruction matrix and higher SNR penatly.  Also, regions will little difference betweeen RF coils (typically in the center of the body), also tend to have larger SNR penalties.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is characterized by the \"g-factor\", where $g(\\vec{r}) \\geq 1$ characterizes a spatially-varying SNR loss that is dependent on the coil loading and geometry, k-space sampling pattern, and parallel imaging reconstruction method.  When appyling an acceleration factor of $R$, the total readout time reduces the SNR by $\\sqrt{R}$ as well, leading to the SNR relationship:\n",

    "### Artifacts with Parallel Imaging\n",
    "\n",
    "Parallel Imaging artifacts typically appear as aliasing.  The undersampled data will have aliasing when not using a parallel imaging reconstruction method, and sometimes the aliasing is not completely removed.  There are also aliasing like artifacts when there is a mismatch between the data and measured coil sensitivity profiles."

    "## Compressed Sensing Methods\n",

There is a regularization factor, $\\lambda_{CS}$, that must be chosen to balance the data consistency and sparsity terms.\n",

Equispaced undersampling results in signal aliasing (d) preventing recovery. Pseudo-random undersampling results in incoherent interference (c). Some strong signal components stick above the interference level, are detected and recovered by thresholding (e) and (f). The interference of these components is computed (g) and subtracted (h), thus lowering the total interference level and enabling recovery of weaker components.\n",
    "\n",
    "Popular sparsifying transforms include total variation (TV), total generalized variation (TGV), and wavelets, where MRI data is typically more sparse.  The pseudo-random undersampling typically uses a variable density that preferentially has more samples near the center of k-space.\n",

    "\n",
    "It is difficult to define SNR when using compressed sensing reconstruction methods, as they inherently perform some denoising when constraining the reconstruction based on sparsity.

    "### Artifacts with Compressed Sensing\n",

For example, they can learn what patterns within the image and/or k-space domain and most relevant and most common in MRI.\n",
