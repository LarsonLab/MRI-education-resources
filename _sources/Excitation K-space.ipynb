    "Excitation k-space is similar to acquisition k-space in many ways, so many intuitions, theoretical properties, and gradient designs can be applied to both.  Acquisition k-space describes the measured spatial frequencies of the object being imaged, while excitation k-space describes the excited spatial frequencies.  They are defined as\n",

Acquisition k-space is defined by the accumulated gradient area, whereas excitation k-space is defined by the remaining gradient area.  Acquisition k-space always starts at the center of k-space, while excitation k-space always ends at the center of k-space.\n",

    "The RF profile is approximately proportional to Fourier Transform of the RF weighting that is created in excitation k-space.  This holds true under the small-tip approximation. Thus, the profile can be controlled by the RF pulse shape and gradients that create the weighting in excitation k-space.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use this principle, excitation k-space, the desired profile (e.g. rect) can be Fourier Transformed to create the desired weighting (e.g. sinc).  The RF pulse shape is this weighting, modulated by the k-space sampling density.  This last step is analogous to density compensation in non-Cartesian MRI reconstruction methods.\n",

    "The excitation k-space trajectory defines limitations of the resulting excitation profile, analogously to acquisition k-space:\n",
    "* Resolution - the resolution or sharpness of the excitation profile is determined by the maximum extent of the excitation k-space trajectory.\n",
    "* Field-of-view (FOV) - the FOV of the excitation profile is determined by the sample spacing of the excitation k-space trajectory.  Beyond this FOV, there will be aliasing of excitation profile."

    "## Multidimensional spatially-selective Pulses\n",
    "\n",
    "To create multidimensional spatially-selective pulses, first a k-space trajectory and a desired profile are chosen.  Then the RF pulse shape is designed based on the desired profile (using Fourier Transform with small-tip approximation) and the density of the k-space trajectory.  For example, 2D pulses are commonly designed with a spiral or echo-planar imaging (EPI) gradient waveforms.  The spacing of the spiral arms and EPI lines determine the excitation FOV.\n",

    "Some use cases of 2D pulses are fast navigator acquisitions and reduced FOV acquisitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The major limitations when using these pulses are pulse duration required to traverse 2D k-space, off-resonance distortions that result during these long pulses, and gradient fidelity that can lead to distortions of the weighting in excitation k-space."

    "Spectral k-space, $k_f$, defines the accumulation of encoding of the spectral or off-resonance domain.  This information simply accumulates over time, so the spectral k-space trajectory is linear with time.\n",

    "In acquisitions, the accumulation of information in spectral k-space is equivalent to the so-called free-induction decay readout in time used in MR spectroscopy.\n",
    "\n",
    "In excitations, spectral accumulates during an RF pulse.  RF pulses without a gradient are spectrally-selective pulses, and can be interpreted as traveling in spectral excitation k-space.  Considering spectral k-space, slice-selective RF pulses travel on an angled trajectory in spectral-spatial k-space.  This angle leads to the artifact of chemical shift or off-resonance slice displacement."
