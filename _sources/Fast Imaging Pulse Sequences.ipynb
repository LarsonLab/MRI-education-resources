    "\n",
    "These pulse sequences use multiple spin-echo refocusing pulses after a single exictation pulse to acquire multiple k-space lines to be acquired during the multiple spin-echoes that are formed.  This technique was originally called Rapid Acquisition with Relaxation Enhancement (RARE), and is known on various MRI scanners as fast spin-echo (FSE, GE Healthcare), turbo spin-echo (TSE, Siemens Healthineers), or turbo field-echo (TFE, Philips Healthcare).\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the most common pulse sequence used in clinical practice.  This is because it is highly SNR efficient and can also be used to generate multiple contrasts.  They are particularly effective for T2 and PD-weighted imaging.\n",

    "\n",
    "A large, unbalanced gradient will create dephasing of the transverse magnetization across the imaging voxels.  This effectively eliminates the signal.  However, the net magnetization is not truly eliminated, and this can be refocused by gradients.\n",
