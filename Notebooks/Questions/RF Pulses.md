# RF Pulses Questions

\item The Specific Absorption Rate (SAR) is proportional to the integrated total RF pulse power, where the pulse power is the pulse amplitude squared.

$$SAR \propto \int_0^{T_{rf}} |b_1(t)|^2 dt$$

$T_{rf}$ is the duration of the RF pulse.
  For for MRI, SAR can cause tissue heating and thus there are SAR safety limits to minimize this heating.

For the pulses in part (a) and (b), which have the same flip angle, which has higher SAR?  What is the ratio of SAR between the pulses?  Justify your answer.



\item For the pulses in part (a) and (c), which have the same duration but different flip angles, which has higher SAR?  What is the ratio of SAR between the pulses?  Justify your answer.


% power ~ T * B1^2, T x2 but B1^2 x1/4
% so 1/2 power

%Since flip angle $ \theta = \gamma B_1 \tau$
%$$\frac{B_{1,2ms}} {B_{1,4ms}}= \frac{\tau_{4ms}}{\tau_{2ms}} = \frac{4ms}{2ms} = 2 $$
%
%Power $ P \propto B_1^2 $
%$$\frac{P_{2ms}}{P_{4ms}} = \frac{B_{1,2ms}^2}{B_{1,4ms}^2} = 2^2 = 4$$
