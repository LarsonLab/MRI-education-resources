    1. For each component, describe a way you could test whether that component is on

    1. For each of the 3 components, draw 1 potential configuration for loop(s) of wires to create/detect the magnetic fields. Also indicate the direction of current flow, and whether this current is typically constant (direct current/DC) or fluctuating (alternating current/AC).
