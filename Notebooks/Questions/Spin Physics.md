# Spin Physics Questions


1. Spin Polarization and Frequency:
There is a slight preference of spins to be aligned with the magnetic field. This is given by the Boltzmann distribution, which determines the ratio of spins in the spin-up and spin-down states. In a magnetic field, spins also precess at the Larmor or resonance frequency.
Under the following conditions, derive the percentage of spins ("polarization") that are aligned with the magnetic field and the resonance frequency of those spins:

    1. Protons where you grew up (the Earth has a magnetic field)
    2. Protons in a 7 T magnetic field
    3. Carbon-13 nuclei in a 7 T magnetic field


1. Equilibrium Magnetization
    1. What is the ratio between the equilibrium magnetization when placing the same material placed in a 3 T MRI scanner compared to a 1.5 T scanner?
    
    1. Suppose this material has a T1 relaxation time of 2 s at 1.5 T. If the material is in a region with no magnetic field, then is instantaneously moved into a 1.5 T MRI scanner, how long will it take the net magnetization to reach 99% of its equilibrium value (M0)?

<!-- $$ M_0 = \frac{N \gamma ^2 \hbar ^2 I_z (I_z + 1) B_0}{3kT}$$
$$ \frac {M_{0,3T}}{M_{0,1.5T}} = \frac{3 \text{T}}{1.5 \text{T}} = 2 $$
The ratio between equilibrium magnetization of 3T compared to 1.5T scanner is 2.

<!-- 
$$ \frac{M_{99\%}}{M_0} = 1 - e^{-t_e/T_1} = 99\% $$
$$t_e = - T_1 \times \log(1-0.99) = -2 \times \log(1-0.99) = 9.21 \text{s}$$
The time this material reaches 99\% equilibrium value is 9.21 seconds
