    "Image reconstruction in MRI means converting the raw signal collected in k-space into images.  For a fully-sampled acquisition using Cartesian sampling (e.g. on a grid), this can be done with a Fourier Transform.  However, the majority of MRI scans are now under-sampled, meaning some samples are skipped to accelerate the scan, which requires more complex image reconstruction methods.\n"
