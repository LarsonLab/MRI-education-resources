    "# Image Reconstruction\n",
    "\n",
    "Image reconstruction in MRI means converting the raw signal collected in k-space into images.  For a fully-sampled acquisition using Cartesian sampling (e.g. on a grid), this can be done with a discrete Fourier Transform.  In anticipation of advanced reconstruction methods, image reconstruction for MRI is formulated as a linear system.  The technique of Partial Fourier imaging is also introduced.\n",
