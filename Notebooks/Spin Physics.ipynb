    "To understand MRI, we must delve into physics and understand what is fundamentally being measured by MRI, which are nuclear \"spins\", and how they behave in a magnetic field which includes the resonance phenomenom that forms the basis of MRI.  A key concept is the \"Net Magnetization\" $\\vec{M}$ which is the sum of all the spins in a given volume.  This chapter provides a higher level overview of these concepts, and a more rigorous mathematical description is provided in the Bloch Equation chapter."

    "\n",
    "A nuclear spin is defined as a nucleus with a non-zero net angular momentum.  This means that the nucleus has a net magnetic moment, $\\mu$, meaning it can act as a small magnet.  It also experiences magnetic resonance, which means it will respond to a specific frequency of electromagnetic fields.  This resonance is the basis for the MRI signal.\n",

    "In MRI, we are tyipcally imaging hydrogen nuclei ($^1 H$) which are about 80% of the atoms in our bodies.  The primary source of $^1 H$, also referred to as protons, is water, although protons in lipids are also imaged. \n",
    "\n",
    "Other nuclei also have spin, including $^{13}C, ^{19}F, ^{23}Na, ^{31}P$, but these are much less abundant and thus have less available signal compared to protons."

In MRI, we cannot measure individual spins, but we observe the ensemble of spins,  which is is known as the Net Magnetization, $\\vec{M}(\\vec{r},t)$.  \n",

    "Another helpful formulation to describe the preference of spins to align with the magnetic field is to look at the fraction of spins that, if observed, would be aligned with the magnetic field.  This can be done using the Boltzman distribution that describes the ratio of spins in the spin-up, $N_\\uparrow$, to the spin-down, $N_-$, states, shown here for spin 1/2 nuclei ($I_Z = 1/2$):\n",

    "\n",
    "In MRI, we can perturb the net magnetization from equilibrium by applying a time-varying magnetic field ($B_1$) at the \"resonance frequency\".  This will perturb or \"tip\" the net magnetization away its equilibrium where it is in alignment with the magnetic field.\n",

    "## Excitation and Precession\n",

    "### Precession \n",
    "\n",
    "Precession refers to the rotation of the spins and therefore the net magnetization around the magnetic field.  This precession is part of the magnetic resonance phenomenom and is what creates signal in MRI.  The spins and net magnetization will rotate around the magnetic field, with the resonance frequency.\n",

    "### Excitation\n",

    "In order for precession to occur, the spins or net magnetization must not be aligned with the magnetic field.  As the nuclear spins are only preferentially aligned with the magnetic field, many of them will experience precession at any given time.  However, the net magnetization will be aligned with the magnetic field at equilibrium, and therefore will not precess.\n",
    "\n",
    "To cause the net magnetization to precess, an time-varying magnetic field ($B_1$) is applied at the resonance frequency.  This perturbs the net magnetization away from alignment with the magnetic field, and it will continue to precess after the $B_1$ field is turned off.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have precession of the net magnetization, it creates a time-varying magnetic field that can then be detected as MRI signal.\n",

    "Relaxation refers to the process by which the net magnetization, our ensemble of individual spins, returns to thermal equilibrium.

These time constants differ depending on tissue composition and structure, and both of these relaxation time constants are valuable sources of MRI contrast.\n",
