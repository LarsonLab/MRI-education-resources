# Introduction to Principles of MRI

This is a short book and associated simulation code for learning the principles of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).  It is based on the https://github.com/LarsonLab/MRI-education-resources repository, a set of helper functions I built up in the course of about a decade of teaching MRI to 1st year graduate students.

Please check back for updates, I'll keep trying to improve this too.

## Getting Started

This book jumps pretty quickly into concepts, for a quick overview of MRI, here's my attempt to explain MRI in under 10 minutes:

## Acknowledgements

This book is greatly influenced by many other great resources that I want to acknowledge up front:

* _Principles of Magnetic Resonance Imaging_ by Dwight Nishimura
* Net magnetizations animation from Bill Overall and the [SpinBench](https://www.heartvista.ai/spinbench) simulation and pulse sequence design tool
* Miki Lustig's MRI course notes
* Educational resources from the [Danish Research Centre for Magnetic Resonance](https://www.drcmr.dk/MR), which includes a great on-line [Bloch Simulation]
