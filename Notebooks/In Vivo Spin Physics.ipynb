    "In living organisms, there are several important spin physics phenoma that influence the MRI signal.  Most significantly these include magnetic susceptibility differences, and chemical shift differences between water and fat protons.\n",
    "There are multiple other phenoma of interest, including flow, diffusion, and magnetization transfer, but they are not covered here."
