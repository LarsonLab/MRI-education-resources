    "A fundamental concept in magnetic resonance and NMR is chemical shift.  This is the phenomenon where the resonance frequency of a nucleus due to shielding created by the orbital motion of surrounding electrons in response to a magnetic field.  Thus the magnetic field experienced by a nucleus is\n",
    "$$ B_{eff} = B_0 (1 + \\sigma)$$\n",
    "where $\\sigma$ is the shielding constant that is dependent on the local chemical environment.  For example, a specific atom in a molecule will have a shielding constant that depends on the electrons in the surrouding atoms of the molecule.\n",
    "\n",
    "The chemical shift, $\\delta$, is defined with respect to a reference frequency, which is typically the resonance frequency of a standard molecule, and is in units of parts per million (ppm).  The is approximately the difference in shielding constant between the reference and the molecule of interest.  This leads to a change in resonance frequency due to chemical shift that is given by\n",

    "### Fat versus Water\n",
    "\n",
    "In MRI, chemical shift most commonly affects the images due to the difference in resonance frequency between fat and water protons.\n",
    "\n",
    "While lipids have a relatively complex set of chemical shifts, in MRI a general \"fat\" signal is typically modeled as a single peak that has a -3.5 parts per million (ppm) shift from water.  This leads to a resonance frequency shift $\\Delta f_{cs}$ of approximately 220 Hz at 1.5 T and 440 Hz at 3 T."
