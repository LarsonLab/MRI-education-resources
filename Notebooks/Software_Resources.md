# MRI Software Resources

This is just a small sample of MRI software resources available!  I've selected a few of my favorites that are focused on education and general pulse sequence/reconstruction methods.

https://github.com/kmjohnson3/Intro-to-MRI
* Python Jupyter notebooks introducting MRI concepts, including examples of advanced reconstructions (variational networks, compressed sensing) and distortion artifacts

https://github.com/mribri999/MRSignalsSeqs
* MRI signals and systems course code and lectures, and builds of introductory MRI courses

https://github.com/markus-nilsson/mri-simulator
* Simulator in MATLAB for Educational Purposes with nice net magnetization illustrations

https://github.com/mikgroup/sigpy
* Python package for signal processing, with powerful MRI reconstruction and MRI pulse design tools

https://github.com/mrirecon/bart
* Popular MRI Reconstruction toolbox with many features for basic and advanced reconstructions 

https://github.com/qMRLab/qMRLab
* quantitative MRI processing methods, from T1 and T2 fitting to susceptibility mapping, diffusion and magnetization transfer

https://github.com/ISMRM/mrhub
* Hub for the entire range of MRI software resources available.  Worth browsing especially when delving into more advanced topics
