    "# In Vivo Contrast Mechanisms\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the basic contrast mechanisms based on T1, T2 and proton density, in vivo tissues and interactions create additional sources of contrast.  These include T2*, susceptibility, fat versus water, and admisistration of contrast agents.  Additional important sources of contrast in vivo include flow and magnetization transfer, but these are not covered here.\n",

    "Ideally, the magnetic field is uniform in the absense of any applied gradients.

These magnetic field variations are referred to as \"off-resonance\", and can be represented as\n",

    "\n",
    "Ideally, the MRI signal decays with a time constant of $T_2$, the transverse decay rate.  However, in practice every imaging voxel contains off-resonance that leads to changes in the signal decay.  We characterize this change in signal decay with $T_2^*$.  \n",

    "The smallest size we can measure with MRI is an imaging voxel, so our image measurements are a sum of the transverse magnetizations across the voxel, including both $T_2$ and off-resonance: \n",

    "\n",
    "(Note that any effects of applied gradients are removed during the image reconstruction process.)\n",
    "\n",
    "The mechanism of this decay is that, across an imaging voxel, the transverse magnetizations across the voxel precess at slightly different rates.  This is called \"de-phasing\", and means that when the transverse magnetization is averaged across the voxel it's overall magnitude is reduced.  This is illustrated in the examples below (generated by ``t2star_spinecho_illustration.m``)\n",

    "$T_2^*$ is an approximation of these dephasing effects, and depends on the voxel size and location.  It is often broken up as follows to separate out the additional dephasing rate, $1/T_2'$:\n",

The microscopic dephasing (T2) cannot be refocused, but the macroscopic dephasing effects can be refocused by using a spin echo sequence.  The macroscopic dephasing is caused by differences in magnetic susceptibility between materials and tissues.\n",
    "\n",
    "While often the macroscopic dephasing effects creating T2* are often undesirable and considered artifacts, T2* is also an important source of contrast to reflect differences in magnetic susceptibility:\n",

    "1. Calcifications: The presence of calcium in a tissue will create shorter T2* due to the strong magnetic susceptibility of calcium.\n",
    "1. Oxygenated vs deoxygenated blood: Deoxygenated blood will have shorter T2* than oxygenated blood due to the magnetic susceptibility of deoxygenated hemoglobin.  This can be used for selectively imaging veins, and is also the basis of blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) functional MRI.\n",

For example, at TE = 80 ms we can expect to see good contrast between white matter ($T_2 \\approx 60$ ms), gray matter ($T_2 \\approx 80$ ms), and cerebrospinal fluid ($T_2 \\approx 1500$ ms) in the brain (see simulations above).\n",

    "## Fat/Water Imaging\n",

    "The major sources of signal in MRI are hydrogen atoms in water molecules and hydrogen atoms in lipids.

This can be exploited to create images that isolate fat and water signals.\n",
    "\n",
    "While lipids have a relatively complex set of chemical shifts, in MRI a general \"fat\" signal is typically modeled as a single peak that has a -3.5 parts per million (ppm) shift from water.  This leads to a resonance frequency shift $\\Delta f_{cs}$ of approximately 220 Hz at 1.5 T and 440 Hz at 3 T.\n",
    "\n",

    "$$S(TE) = S_{water} + S_{fat} exp(-i 2 \\pi \\Delta f_{cs} TE)$$\n",
