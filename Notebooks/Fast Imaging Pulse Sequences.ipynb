    "These pulse sequences use multiple spin-echo refocusing pulses after a single exictation pulse.  This enables multiple k-space lines to be acquired during the multiple spin-echoes that are formed.  This technique was originally called Rapid Acquisition with Relaxation Enhancement (RARE), and is known on various MRI scanners as fast spin-echo (FSE, GE Healthcare), turbo spin-echo (TSE, Siemens Healthineers), or turbo field-echo (TFE, Philips Healthcare)."
