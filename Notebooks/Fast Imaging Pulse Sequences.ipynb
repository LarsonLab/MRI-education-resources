This enables multiple k-space lines to be acquired during the multiple spin-echoes that are formed.  This technique was originally called Rapid Acquisition with Relaxation Enhancement (RARE), and is known on various MRI scanners as fast spin-echo (FSE, GE Healthcare), turbo spin-echo (TSE, Siemens Healthineers), or turbo field-echo (TFE, Philips Healthcare)."

    "The basic gradient-echo sequence is typically a spoiled gradient-echo sequence.  The sequence is called spoiled because the transverse magnetization is spoiled by a spoiler gradient before the next RF pulse.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Spoiler or Crusher gradients\n",
    "\n",
    "A large, unbalanced gradient will create dephasing of the transverse magnetization across the imaging voxels.  This effectively eliminates the signal.  However, the net magnetization is not truly eliminated, and this can be refocused by gradients.\n",
    "\n",
    "### RF spoiling\n",
    "\n",
    "The RF axis of rotation is changed every TR.  This reduces the chances of magnetization from previous TRs to become coherently excited.  Specific RF spoiling schemes, such as quadratic phase incrementation, is required for this to be effective.\n",
