    "There are two broad classes of pulse sequences used: gradient-echo and spin-echo methods.  Gradient-echo sequences use a simpler pulse and acquire acquisition, while spin-echo sequences use an additional RF refocusing pulse that eliminates the effects of off-resonance that are often undesirable."

    "Gradient-echo sequences are sensitive to off-resonance effects and exhibit T2* contrast.  However, the effects of off-resonance can be reversed by applying a 180-degree flip angle \"refocusing\" RF pulse some time after the initial excitation RF pulse.  This has the effect of inverting the phase accumulation of off-resonance net magnetizations, after which the off-resonance phase begins to cancel out.  This is most easily illustrated in the voxel decay illustrations below:\n",
