    "\n",
    "There are two broad classes of pulse sequences used: gradient-echo and spin-echo methods.  Gradient-echo sequences use a simpler pulse and acquire acquisition, while spin-echo sequences use an additional RF refocusing pulse that eliminates the effects of off-resonance that are often undesirable."

    "Ideally, the magnetic field is uniform in the absense of any applied gradients.  However, in practice there are unavoidable variations in the magnetic field that lead to changes in resonance frequency.  These magnetic field variations are referred to as \"off-resonance\", and can be represented as\n",

    "$$\\Delta f_r(\\vec{r})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This typically includes imperfections in the main $B_0$ magnetic as well as subject-specific changes in the magnetic field that are largely due to magnetic susceptibility effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Effects of Off-resonance and T2*\n",
    "\n",
    "Ideally, the MRI signal decays with a time constant of $T_2$, the transverse decay rate.  However, in practice every imaging voxel contains off-resonance that leads to changes in the signal decay.  We characterize this change in signal decay with $T_2^*$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The smallest size we can measure with MRI is an imaging voxel, so our image measurements are a sum of the transverse magnetizations across the voxel, including both $T_2$ and off-resonance: \n",

    "\\end{align}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "(Note that any effects of applied gradients are removed during the image reconstruction process.)\n",
    "\n",
    "The mechanism of this decay is that, across an imaging voxel, the transverse magnetizations across the voxel precess at slightly different rates.  This is called \"de-phasing\", and means that when the transverse magnetization is averaged across the voxel it's overall magnitude is reduced.\n",
    "\n",
    "$T_2^*$ is an approximation of these dephasing effects, and depends on the voxel size and location.  It is often broken up as follows to separate out the additional dephasing rate, $1/T_2'$:\n",
