# MRI Education Resources
Resources for learning the principles of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)

Currently MATLAB based functions and demonstrations (Octave compatible too)

## Interactive Book

Included in this repository are the contents of an interactive book that uses many of the functions contained.  The content of the book is saved in `Notebooks/`, and can be viewed at
